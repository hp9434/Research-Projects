## Code for Impact of Sharing Imprecise Information on Fixed-Bin Selective Assembly by Clottey and Benton 2024
The code in this GITHUB repository is example R code for the analysis performed when precise information about the mean of the Piston diameters is communicated by the supplier 
and either a Reactive or Proactive approach to FBSA is utilized.
The results of running the code is raw data for surplus/shortage of FBSA parts when the reactive and proactive strategies are utilized.
The results also provide the raw data forecasts used with the Proactive and Reactive approaches over the simulation period. The results are exported in an Excel format.
Thesame R code was modified for each of the scenarios in Table 1 of the manuscript and also for the sensitivey analyses performed in Tables 3 & 4 of the mansucript.
The values shown in Tables 1, 3 & 4 and in Figures 3,4 & 5 of the manuscript were obtained via use of the exported results within Excel to obtain cost and efficiency measures,
as detailed on pages 16 and 17 of the manuscript.
